## Deployment Details

### Hosting Information

- **Platform**: Static website hosting via Manus Create
- **URL**: https://gbsqjbgi.manus.space

### Technical Implementation

The Digital Quest game is implemented as a browser-based application using:

The application runs entirely in the browser without requiring any server-side processing beyond serving the static files.

2. **SEO Enhancements**: Meta tags were added for improved search engine visibility
3. **Responsive Design**: The interface adapts to different screen sizes
4. **Security Headers**: Content Security Policy and other security headers were configured
5. **Caching**: Appropriate cache headers were set for static assets
