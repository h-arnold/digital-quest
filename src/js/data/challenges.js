For a signal with frequency components up to 10 kHz, the minimum sampling rate would be 20 kHz.

    "educational_content": "Logic gates are the fundamental building blocks of digital circuits. An AND gate outputs 1 only when all inputs are 1 (otherwise 0). An OR gate outputs 1 if any input is 1. A NOT gate inverts the input. An XOR (exclusive OR) gate outputs 1 if inputs are different, 0 if they're the same.

    "educational_content": "Software licenses define how software can be used, modified, and distributed. Proprietary licenses restrict copying and modification. Public domain has no restrictions. Permissive open source licenses (like MIT) allow almost any use with minimal requirements. Copyleft licenses (like GPL) require derivative works to use the same license and provide source code, ensuring software remains open.

    "educational_content": "Recursion is when a function calls itself. While powerful, recursive functions must have a base case (a condition where the function stops calling itself) to prevent infinite recursion, which consumes memory and processing power until the system crashes. This is similar to how loops need exit conditions. Proper recursion design includes: 1) A base case to terminate recursion, 2) A recursive case that moves toward the base case, and 3) Proper parameter management.",

    "failure_text": "The Cloud Controller shakes their head. 'I'm afraid that approach is inefficient.' The cloud resources either collapse under excessive load or waste resources during quiet periods, creating a storm of error messages that rain down on you.",
    "educational_content": "Cloud scaling refers to adjusting resources to match demand. Fixed resources waste money during low demand and may fail during unexpected spikes. Manual scaling requires constant monitoring and slow human intervention. Scheduled scaling works for predictable patterns but fails with unexpected changes. Auto-scaling uses real-time metrics (CPU usage, request count, etc.) to automatically adjust resources, optimizing both performance and cost for unpredictable workloads.",

    "failure_text": "The Version Control Manager winces. 'That approach would cause problems.' The repository explodes into a tangled mess of conflicting code that blocks your path until you find another way around.",
    "educational_content": "Merge conflicts occur in version control when different developers make conflicting changes to the same part of a file. Resolving conflicts requires careful examination of both changes to determine the correct combination. Blindly accepting one set of changes risks losing valuable work or introducing bugs. Modern version control systems like Git provide tools to help identify and resolve conflicts, but human judgment is still needed for proper resolution.",

    "educational_content": "Phishing attempts try to trick users into revealing sensitive information by masquerading as legitimate entities. Key warning signs include: creating artificial urgency, requesting sensitive information, suspicious sender addresses (check carefully - they often use slight misspellings), suspicious links (hover to see the actual URL), poor grammar/spelling, generic greetings, and requests that bypass normal security procedures.

This license is typically broad, allowing the platform to display, distribute, modify, and sometimes sublicense the content. However, ownership remains with the creator.
